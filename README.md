## Background information

This repository shows a complementary analysis of crime and the judicial system in the United States of America. We use two core R data sets (*USJudgesRatings* and *USArrests*), illustrate the datas' distributions using descriptive statistics and transform the data. 

## Analysis of USJudgesRatings

For the *USJudgesRatings* dataset, which contains lawyers' ratings of state judges in the US Superior Court, we develop a weighted index of Judge's individual performance. [This pdf document](https://github.com/fabianbohnenberger/repo1/blob/master/analysis/USJudges/USJudges_RMarkdown.pdf) shows the rating of US Supreme Court Justices. Additional information on this dataset can be found here: <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/USJudgeRatings.html">USJudgesRatings</a>

## Analysis of USArrests

The second analysis complements the first by showing the number of arrests for the crimes of murder and assault per 100,000 residents in all US States. Further information on the dataset can be found [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/USArrests.html). Also included in the information is the percentage of the population that lives in urban areas.

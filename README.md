## Aim

We use two core R data sets (*USJudgesRatings* and **addname**), illustrate the datas' distributions using  descriptive statistics and transform the data. 

For the *USJudgesRatings* dataset, which contains lawyers' ratings of state judges in the US Superior Court, we develop a weighted index of Judge's individual performance.

Additional information on this dataset can be found here: <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/USJudgeRatings.html">USJudgesRatings</a>

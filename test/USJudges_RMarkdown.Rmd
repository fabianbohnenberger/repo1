## Aim

The aim of this doccument is to develop a weighted index of Judge's performance based on R's **"USJudgeRatings"** database. The dataset contains lawyers' ratings of State Judges in the US Superior Court. Additional information on the dataset can be found here: <https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/USJudgeRatings.html>

Data on four variables will be used: 

|variable| abbreviation|
|------|---|
|*Judicial integrity* | INTG|
|*Preparation for trial* | PREP|
|*Sound oral rulings* | ORAL|
|*Physical ability* | PHYS|

##Descriptive Statistics 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(USJudgeRatings)
```

judgerating <- USJudgeRatings


##Creating a weighted index


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#assigning observations to objects ($ = "component selector") 
x1 <- USJudgeRatings$INTG
x2 <- USJudgeRatings$PREP
x3 <- USJudgeRatings$ORAL
x4 <- USJudgeRatings$PHYS
```

###Defining weights for the Index
```{r}
#defining weights for index
w1 <- 0.25
w2 <- 0.25
w3 <- 0.25
w4 <- 0.25
```

###Creating function for weighted Index
r identifies the row/Judge
```{r}
weighted_index <- function(r){
  x1[r]*w1+x2[r]*w2+x3[r]*w3+x4[r]*w4
}
``` 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#adjusting Index to deal with numbers for r other than integers between 1 and 43
weighted_index <- function(r){
  if(1 <= r && r <= 43 && r == as.integer(r)){
    x1[r]*w1+x2[r]*w2+x3[r]*w3+x4[r]*w4
  } 
  else{
    print("Judge does not exist")
  }
}


```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
